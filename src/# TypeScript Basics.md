 # TypeScript Basics

This repository contains a TypeScript file that demonstrates some of the basic features of the language, including variables, functions, objects, and type aliases.

## Variables

TypeScript uses the `let` keyword to declare variables. Variables can be assigned any type of value, and their type can be inferred from the value they are assigned. For example, the following code declares a variable called `my_age` and assigns it the value 30:

```typescript
let my_age: number = 30;
```

## Functions

Functions in TypeScript are declared using the `function` keyword. Functions can take parameters and return a value. The following code declares a function called `totalPrice` that takes two parameters, `price` and `tax`, and returns the total price of an item after tax:

```typescript
const totalPrice = (price: number, tax = 10): number => {
  let taxed = (price * tax) / 100;
  return taxed + price;
};
```

The `=>` syntax is used to define arrow functions. Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions that do not require a block statement.

## Objects

Objects in TypeScript are declared using the `{}` syntax. Objects can contain properties and methods. The following code declares an object called `student` that has three properties: `id`, `name`, and `email`:

```typescript
let student: Student = {
  id: Math.random(),
  name: "John",
  email: "",
};
```

The `Student` type is a type alias that defines the shape of the `student` object. Type aliases are a way to give a name to a type, which can make code more readable and maintainable.

## Type Aliases

Type aliases are declared using the `type` keyword. Type aliases can be used to give a name to a type, which can make code more readable and maintainable. The following code declares a type alias called `Student` that defines the shape of the `student` object:

```typescript
type Student = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};
```
